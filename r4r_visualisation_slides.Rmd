* The "Visualisation" module follows on from the introduction to R you've had so far
* We'll start by outlining the through the two major graphics packages in R: "base" and `ggplot2`
* 
* Then tomorrow, we'll look at some specific "advanced" visualisation techniques relevant to archaeology:
  * First spatial visualisations and mapping, following on from last week's module on spatial analysis
  * Then a selection of other specific applications – subject to change!
* And finally, on Wednesday, we'll discuss preparing plots ready for final publication
* I would like this to be as hands-on as possible, so the format for this module is you doing exercises at your own pace, with me dropping in to explain things as needed

# Visualisation with R
## Introduction

???

* Why use R for visualisations? Or: why did we devote a quarter of this course to visualisation?
* Most of you are probably here because, in some way or other, you want to use R to "do statistics"
* As you go up the admittedly steeper learning curve of visualisations in R, you might ask: why not just export the result to a more intuitive programme like Excel, and make the plots there?
* For that I have three answers:
  * (or four: the zeroth being because Excel is bad software, don't use it)

.center[<small>Data science workflow. After Wickham & Grolemund, *R for Data Science*</small>]

???

* First—and this is why we are we looking at visualisations now, rather than at the end—is that visualisation is not just the end product of a statistical analysis, something you use to **communicate**, but right at its centre, as something that helps us **understand**.
* In the exploratory data analysis (EDA) or modern "data science" workflow (illustrated very nicely here in a figure from Hadley Wickham's *R for Data Science*), visualisation is one of the pillars of data analysis
* You should use graphics often, to help you understand data as you go through the iterative cycle of interrogating and modelling it

???

* This is an old idea: starting with 'exploratory data analysis', and continued in modern 'data science'
* Computers obviously make it a lot easier to generate plots quickly;
* And R was in fact originally designed to facilitate EDA, so it's very well suited for it: once you've mastered the basic graphics functions, you can generate plots easily and often

# R: a statistical *programming language*

1. Iterate
2. Scale
3. Reproduce

???

* Second, R is a statisical *programming language*. This has powerful advantages compared to traditional workflows for producing plots:
  * Iteration: generate your final plot and realise you need to change something in the source data? No problem!
  * Scalability: write code to visualise X about Y; then run it on 1000 (or 10000, or 100000) values of Y
  * Reproducibility: everybody can see exactly the steps you took to produce a plot

## `bbplot` <<https://github.com/bbc/bbplot>>

???

* Third, R graphics simply do look very nice. Maybe not always 'out of the box', but the capability is there.
* For example, ... all use R for their statistical graphics

# Graphics packages in R

data("BACups")
```

???

* There isn't one way to produce plots in R: you have to pick a **graphics package**
* The main options are "base" (actually `graphics`), `ggplot2`, and `lattice` (now rarely used)
* These packages have major differences in syntax, and by extension flexibility and capabilities

* These differences are highlighted when you try to do more complex plots
* Don't get hung up on the aesthetic differences – these are defaults, you can easily make one look like the other (or anything else)
* There is some debate over the pros and cons of each – I see ggplot2 as a straightforward upgrade and from this afternoon we will focus on its approach
* But it's helpful to be familiar with base as the 'default' in a lot of cases, e.g. used by many packages to plot complex data structures, so we'll start with that

# `ggplot2`: the 'grammar of graphics'

???

* `ggplot2` is based on the "grammar of graphics"
* This is a somewhat theoretical concept. Further reading: 
  * Wickham 2010, *A Layered Grammar of Graphics*
  * Wilkinson, Anand & Grossman 2005, *The Grammar of Graphics*
* But it's helpful to have some idea of that theory, to make sense of random prefixes like "aes" or "geom"

---
class: center, middle

# The Grammar of Graphics

![](figures/grammar-of-graphics.png)

???

* The grammer is a structured way of *describing* the relationship between data and graphical elements (declarative) – as opposed to `base` graphics, which is you *telling* R what to plot (imperative)
* Specifically, `ggplot` introduces a *layered* grammer of graphics, allowing you to combine multiple mappings into a single plot
* This makes it much more flexible than base and allows us to maintain readable code for even very complicated plots
* Downsides: data does have to be in a roughly tabular (if not fully "tidy") structure to work well with ggplot. Complex objects from other packages can be a challenge to work with.
  * For EDA purposes, it's often better to fall back on `base::plot()` with these objects
  * Though packages like `broom` can help

* We've seen how to do a few fundamental plots with ``ggplot2` this morning, but using "dummy" datasets like `cars` and `diamonds`. 
* What are some archaeological applications of these plots?
* Tomorrow we will look at some more niche types of visualisation in archaeology;
* For now, we continue to work on the fundamentals of using visualisation EDA

# Tidy data

![](figures/r4rds-tidy-1.png)

???

* As I mentioned this morning, a big part of producing graphics effectively is having the tools to transform data to the right format
* And `ggplot2` is generally super-charged when used as part of a "tidy data analysis" workflow
* With the example data you've used so far, this has been done for you. With "real world" archaeology data, it won't be!

* For example, *pipes* allow us to elegantly and concisely load data, clean and filter, and plot in a single code block
* Half of the code here—the most important half—is *reshaping* the data before even giving it to the plot. Often, it's more than half!
* You can read more about reshaping or "wrangling" data in *R for Data Science*
